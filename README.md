This is the first game I have ever created, the sprites and images are designed by myself.

History:

While exploring space, an astronaut accidentally lands on a dangerous planet where the ground randomly disappears, turning into black holes.
The locals aren't friendly either. Undaunted, the astronaut bravely faces these challenges, navigating a perilous landscape where every step could lead to the unknown abyss.

Rules:

Move character:  Arrow keys
Vanish random ground:  Enter/Space
Boost speed:  Shift
Description:  Stay clear of the indigenous inhabitants and be cautious, as vanishing ground can lead to falling into a black hole.
